Find one object that is pointed by all other objects. Find the center of graph (2)
Compute all elements of A (by the help of Floyd-Warshall algorithm)

# dist(i) - length of shortest path from i to its farthest vertex
For i = 1 to N
    dist(i) = 0
    For j = 1 to N
        If ( i != j AND A(i,j) > dist(i) ) Then dist(i)=A(i,j)
End For i

center = 1
For i = 1 to N
    If dist(i) < dist(center) Then center = i

Output center
